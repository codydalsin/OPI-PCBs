*** PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME FILES (*.GM1, *.GPB, etc.) may not be required to produce this PCB.

Notes:
======

1)	Internal Plane Layers are negatives.

2)	Vias on this PCB are NOT tented.

3)	Gold Plating on this PCB is only required on the 12 position edge connector.

4)	This PCB fits into a plastic enclosure with tight tolerances.  Any breakaway tab edges that protude
	from the OUTSIDE edge of the PCB have to be manually removed by OPI so that the outer edge is smooth
	before the unit	is installed in the pastic enclosure.

	This PCB has five (5) copper and internal plane relief areas that mouse bytes can be installed.  The
	intent here is that the shard breakaway section can be INTERNAL to the edge of the PCB and not have
	to be manually filed or otherwise removed by production personel.

	Suggested drill size for the mouse bytes is 0.024".

5)	In areas where chamfering is required, internal plane and out layer copper is relieved.  There are
	five (5) chamfered edges on this PCB.

6)	All holes are specified FHS.

7)	Layer Stackup of this PCB is as follows:

	Component Side Copper
	Internal Layer 1
	Internal Layer 2
	Solder Side Copper

8)	OPI Manufacturing and test would like if these PCBs are supplied on a two up panel, with a 0.500" clearance
	between the two PCB images.  A simple text drawing of the panel setup is shown below:

	Panel border of 0.062 FR4 material is 0.500.

9)	Due to the enclosure tolerances, one of the radius corners identified on the Mechanical Layer 4
	needs to be reduced, ideally to as close to a 90 degree corner as possible.  The easiest way
	to do this is to a) use a smaller 0.080 router bit, and to b) slightly router into the outline of
	the PCB approx. 0.040 (half router bit width) in the Vertical Y Axis.  

	Note that the Outer and Inner Plane Copper areas have been relieved for	this purpose.	

Please send me an email if you have any other questions or concerns.

Thank you.
